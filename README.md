# Recipe Suggestion Application
This repository contains the source code for the Recipe Suggestion Application for Student Smart Homes.


### Project Information

The aim of this application is to make the lives of customers of Student Smart Homes simpler by providing them with an application that can, on demand, suggest recipes for them to make with the ingredients available in their fridge. This would mean that students do not have to waste their already strained time with planning their meals. This application works by populating a database with information about a student's fridge. It then uses this information to generate and display a suggested list of recipes for the student based on their available ingredients. The user can also interact with the user interface to filter these recipes based on different preferences.


### How to Get Started With the Project

Start by running the server and then run the client. By running these classes the database will automatically load into your device's memory. 

The user interface will appear on your screen. To generate a list of suggested recipes you can press the 'generate recipes' button. A list of the top 5 recipes will then appear on the user interface. 

You can choose to either filter these recipes using the filter button at the top right of the user interface, or click on any of the five recipes to view more information about each of them (e.g. the recipe instructions and necessary ingredients). If you click on one of the suggested recipes, there is a back button at the top left of the user interface so that you can navigate back to the list of suggested recipes.
