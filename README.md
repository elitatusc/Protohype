# Recipe Suggestion Application
This repopsitory contains the source code for the recipe suggestion application for Student Smart Homes.


### Project Information

The aim of this application is to make the lives of customers of Student Smart Homes simpler by providing them with an application that can, on demand, suggest recipes for them to make with the ingredients available in their fridge. This would mean that students do not have to waste their already strained time with planning their meals. This application works by populating a database with information about a student's fridge. It then uses this information to generate and display a suggested list of recipes for the student based on their available ingredients. The user can also interact with the user interface to filter these recipes based on different preferences.
