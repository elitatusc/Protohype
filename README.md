# Recipe Suggestion Application
This repopsitory contains the source code for the recipe suggestion application.


### What the Application Does

This application populates a database with information about a student's fridge. It then uses this information to generate a suggested list of recipes for the student, based on the available ingredients. The user can also filter these recipes.


### Why the Application is Useful

The aim of this application is to make the lives of customers of Student Smart Homes simpler by providing them with an application that can, on demand, suggest recipes for them to make with the ingredients available in their fridge.
